To ensure consistency across different browsers, it was suggested to implement a CSS reset for common elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists. 

 CSS Flexbox allows the design to adapt to various screen sizes and a media query was included to adjust the navigation and accessability for small devices.

I was playing around with the color palette with dark blue and light grays to evoke a sense of professionalism and energy, fitting the racing theme. The contrast between the header's dark background and white text enhances readability.

 Headers have been styled to provide a clear hierarchy, guiding users through the content.

 navigation bar at the top allows users to jump to different sections of the page quickly. 

 email address allows user to reach out with any questions.
